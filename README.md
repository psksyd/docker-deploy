# @psk/docker-publish

npm scripts to automate docker images.

An easy way to excute the typical sequence of building, running and pushing a docker image out of a node project to a private docker repo,
or the public docker hub.

Uses the name and version number from package.json to keep your docker image name and version aligned.

## Usage

in your project, execute

    npm install @psk/docker-publish --save

If you are pushing to a private docker repo, add the following to your package.json

      "docker-registry": "docker.your-private.com",

Or if you are pushing to the public docker hub, add the following to your package.json

    "docker-user": "ryanramage".

Add some scripts that look like this. You might adjust to your liking

      "scripts": {
    	    "docker-build": "rm -rf node_modules && npm i --production &&  docker-build",
    	    "docker-push": "docker-push",
      },

Now in your project, when you are ready to make a new image, bump your version number in package.json.

To build a local docker image quickly, for running later

    npm run docker-build

Push the docker image to the docker-registry specified in your package.json

    npm run docker-push
